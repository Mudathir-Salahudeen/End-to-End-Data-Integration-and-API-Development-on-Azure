This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive data pipeline and API integration using Azure services. 
The pipeline extracts data from MongoDB, processes it, and makes it accessible via RESTful APIs.

Key Components:
Data Extraction: Leveraged Azure Data Factory to extract data from MongoDB using an API.
Data Transformation and Loading: Transformed and loaded the extracted data into a PostgreSQL database.
API Development: Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to access the data stored in PostgreSQL.
API Documentation: Documented the APIs using Swagger for easy access and understanding.
API Hosting: Deployed the APIs on Azure API Management (APIM) for secure and scalable access.

Access to APIs:
The final interface to access the APIs is available at GeoST4R APIM.
Note: Access is restricted to authenticated users only, as this project is intended for organizational use and is not publicly accessible.
